Rizon Quotes Extractor
======================

Extracts quotes from the Rizon `Quotes` bot, and outputs them as json and csv.

Doesn't have any requirements outside the Python standard library.

Running
-------

    python2.7 extract.py /your/log/directory


You should edit the `admins` variable to list your channel admins, so the script will detect .quote del and remove accordingly.
